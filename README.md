# kraken-meta-order
This is a tool to help make and manage more complex crypto orders with the Kraken exchange. I kind of abandoned it when the crypto craze of 2021 died down. Maybe I'll start working on it again if Bitcoin gets back to 50k.

Start the app with:

```
docker-compose up
```

The DB will start on port 5432, and the server will listen on port 8080. You can use the included Postman collection to create, read, update and delete meta orders.
